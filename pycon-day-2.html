</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>During the second day of PyCon I was still a little overwhelmed by the number of people around. That's something that I definitely need to figure out a better way to deal with other than just entering into a little shell of my own. Because of this I spent most of the time helping out at the booth and showing people the projects that we had brought. This day was much longer than the first day, and while there were a lot of people who were really interested in what we were doing, there were also a lot of people who were really confused about the fact that we were a group of students from a college, there to talk about the coursework that we do. </p>
<p>SJ was spending all day walking around to the different booths talking with companies about potential co-ops and full time positions for his students. During his time walking around he talked with a company called Amplify. Amplify is an educational company. They create educational games as well as an educational suite of software. This suite has things including ways of testing the students as well as an in depth look at each student and where they might need more focus. They ended up speaking about me and the project I've been working on WoW Diabetes. When SJ got back to the booth he mentioned that he had spoken about me and that I should go talk to them to see if they might have any job openings. I didn't get a chance to go over there right away but hopefully in the next couple of days I will get the opportunity.</p>
