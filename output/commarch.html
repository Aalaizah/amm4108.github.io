<h4>Questions</h4>
<p><strong>1. Describe software project, its purpose and goals.</strong>
“Pyramid is a very general open source Python web framework. As a framework, its primary job is to make it easier for a developer to create an arbitrary web application. The type of application being created isn’t really important; it could be a spreadsheet, a corporate intranet, or a social networking platform. Pyramid is general enough that it can be used in a wide variety of circumstances.”([Pyramid About Page])(http://www.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/about)</p>
<p><strong>2. Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?</strong>
The project started out as BFG or repoze.bfg. This was started in June, 2008. In December of 2010, when Pylons was started, it became Pyramid. Some features were removed and other were removed when this happened. The latest commit(as of this writing) was March 13, 2015</p>
<p><strong>3. Who approves patches? How many people?</strong>
The Pylons developers approve patches. They don’t seem to talk about a more in depth answer, but according to GitHub there are 4 people who have pushed commits to the main repo.</p>
<p><strong>4. Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?</strong>
Four people have commit access. Steve Piercy, Russell Ballestrini, Junya Hayashi, and Eric Parent. There are 100 contributors listed on the GitHub repo.</p>
<p><strong>5. Who has the highest amounts of "Unique Knowledge?" (As per your "Git-by-a-bus" report. If there is a tie, list each contributor, with links if possible)</strong>
Chris McDonough</p>
<p><strong>6. What is your project's "Calloway Coefficient of Fail?"</strong>
30-60 points of FAIL: Babies cry when your code is downloaded</p>
<p><strong>7. Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the same top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)</strong>
Since October 10th, 2011, Chris McDonough or Mcdonc came around, it changed from the “Mighty Python Framework” to the “Python Web Framework”. Out of a total 8,139 commits, he’s done 2,443 of them. Git_by_a_bus showed him to be a part of 7,747 of the 12,799 files in python.</p>
<p><strong>8. Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)</strong>
Chris McDonough or Mcdonc, see previous answer.</p>
<p><strong>9. Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?</strong>
There is no real front end developers as Pyramid uses several templating engines.</p>
<p><strong>10. What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?</strong>
After browsing github’s issue history, Michael Merickel or mmerickel appears to be the foremost bug repairer. Out of the last 38 bugs, he has either opened, closed, or commented on 24 of them. The bugs seem to arise when a new version is released, a new feature is tested, or when they attempt to get a new feature to work on windows.</p>
<p><strong>11. How is the project's participation trending and why?</strong>
Number of commits is going down recently as Pyramid is very stable right now.</p>
<p><strong>12. In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?</strong>
It does not pass the raptor test, Chris McDonough puts out more code than the next 19 combined. Someone else might pick up the reigns, but it would surely change as much as it did when he joined in October 2011.</p>
<p><strong>13. In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?</strong>
I dunno, probably not. I think I would work on the project then with Ryan Brown and we’ll fix it up. Of the 7th top developer and lesser developers, no one does work on more than 80 files.</p>
<p><strong>14. Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place? (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)</strong>
If you’re a major contributor, then yes. More info at http://www.pylonsproject.org/community/how-to-contribute</p>
<p><strong>15. Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive? Does it include code examples?</strong>
Yes. Yes. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>16. If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?</strong>
I would contact Ryan Brown by Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>17. Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?</strong>
Rules by a small group of six people who are all major contributors and comment on patches.</p>
<p><strong>18. Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?</strong>
I don't know enough Python to feel comfortable working on a major Pyton project. However if I did know more Python I would be okay working on a project like this one.</p>
