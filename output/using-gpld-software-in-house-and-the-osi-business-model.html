<ul>
<li>Using GPL'd Software In-House<ul>
<li>Bradley M. Kuhn</li>
<li>Anthony K. Sebro, Jr.</li>
<li>Denver Gingerich</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The OSI Business Model<ul>
<li>Open Source Initiative</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h4>What</h4>
<ul>
<li>Copyleft and the GNU General Public License: A Comprehensive Tutorial and Guide</li>
<li>Open Source Case for Business</li>
</ul>
<h4>Where</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bizlegfoss-ritigm.rhcloud.com/static/books/comprehensive-gpl-guide.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank">Copyleft and the GNU General Public License: A Comprehensive Tutorial and Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="http://opensource.org/advocacy/case_for_business.php">Open Source Case for Business</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>When</h4>
<ul>
<li>Originally released in 2003 but has seen many updates with the latest being in 2014</li>
<li>Last "Updated" in 2014</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Gist</h4>
<ul>
<li>Companies can use GPL'd software throughout a company without having to worry about anything.</li>
<li>There are advantages and disadvantages from most of the different business perspectives. There are four "known" business models for open source money making: Support sellers, loss leader, widget frosting, and accessorizing. </li>
</ul>
<h4>The Good</h4>
<ol>
<li>It's short and to the point.</li>
<li>GPL'd Software can be shared throughout a company.</li>
<li>While it's not often advertised to the regular consumer, there are a lot of big name products that are open source.</li>
</ol>
<h4>The Bad</h4>
<ol>
<li>While it being short is nice, it also means theres not a lot of substance or explanation.</li>
<li>Examples are out of date. While it's nice to have them in there, if the people reading it don't know what the example is, it's not very helpful.</li>
<li>This really only deals with the theoretical, and the theoretical isn't always how things pan out in practice.</li>
</ol>
<h4>The Questions</h4>
<ol>
<li>How are other licenses dealt with when trying to use them for company purposes?</li>
<li>Are these all of the possible FOSS business models that are in use? </li>
<li>How can we show companies that FOSS isn't necessarily a bad thing? That you can make money off of it and it might actually make your product better?</li>
</ol>
<h4>Review</h4>
<p>Using GPL'd Software is a short and sweet section of what is potentially a great book. It offers an interesting piece of information without bogging the reader down in too much unneeded info.
6 Red Roses and 6 White Roses</p>
<p>The OSI Business Model is a much longer read. While it has some really good information, there is a lot that is outdated. It has broken links and examples that not everyone will have heard of.
