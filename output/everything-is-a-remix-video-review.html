<p>StarveTheSystem2</p>
<h3>What</h3>
<p>Everything is a Remix</p>
<h3>Where</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coGpmA4saEk&quot; target=&quot;_blank">YouTube</a></p>
<h3>When</h3>
<p>June 25, 2012</p>
<h3>The Gist</h3>
<p>Copy, Transform, Combine. This is the basis of all creativity. Intelectual Property has overtaken the idea of the common good.</p>
<h3>The Good</h3>
<ol>
<li>There is an extremely well thought out argument. </li>
<li>When he was talking about the videos his visuals were extremely helpful.  </li>
<li>For people who already use ideas from other places and just combine them in different ways it's nice to know other people have done it too. </li>
</ol>
<h3>The Bad</h3>
<ol>
<li>There wasn't a link in the description to their sources page. I had to dig into their website. </li>
<li>When he was talking about everything besides the videos the visuals were extremely distracting.</li>
<li>It could be very disheartening for a person who thinks their ideas are original to realize that they might not be. </li>
</ol>
<h3>The Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Does everyone purposely use other things the way George Lucas did, or is it done accidentally?</li>
<li>Why did James Kirby make this video?</li>
<li>How is it actually determined if code has been copied?</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Review</h3>
<p>Everything is a Remix is an interesting way to show how many of our famous works, including videos, songs, and code, are all derivatives. 
Half a dozen red roses and three white roses.</p>
