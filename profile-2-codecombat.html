<h4>Community Architecture</h4>
<ol>
<li>Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.<ul>
<li>The goal of this project is create a game where kids can learn to code while completing levels. It’s not meant to teach you to be an engineer, but to teach you how to intensively practice the programming fundamentals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?<ul>
<li>Latest commit was 10 hours ago (as of 1/2/15 9:30am)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who approves patches? How many people?<ul>
<li>http://i.imgur.com/J1id9Yx.png</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted? How many total?<ul>
<li>http://i.imgur.com/J1id9Yx.png</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)</li>
<li>Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)<ul>
<li>The project has two lead developers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?<ul>
<li>No they are different people. It looks like on the core team it’s pretty even. But as far as other contributors it’s hard to tell. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?</li>
<li>How is the project's participation trending and why?<ul>
<li>Trending up. They’ve had a lot of active users, especially with the trend of trying to get young students into STEM fields. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?<ul>
<li>I would hope so, there are a ton of active developers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?<ul>
<li>Probably not. the most active 20% are people who are employed to create this game. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place? (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)<ul>
<li>http://codecombat.com/contribute </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Even if you’re learning how to code, there are other things that you can contribute to.<ul>
<li>http://codecombat.com/cla </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive? Does it include code examples?<ul>
<li>yes to both  https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Component </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?<ul>
<li>Message anyone their hipchat. Or create an issue on github.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group? Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?<ul>
<li>barely contained chaos, there are over 200 issues. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?<ul>
<li>I would enjoy working in this. I work really well in chaotic situations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
