<p>Getting coffee this morning turned into me pitching WoW Diabetes to a WoW dev.  Apparently they have a list of things they do when they need a break or are extra stressed, and he added this to the list. I can't wait to keep working on this and start really polishing it. </p>
<h4>Audio Designer and More Coffee</h4>
<p>While waiting for the Expo floor to open I was standing near the line for one of the coffee places inside the convention center, I was asked multiple times if I was in line as well. When one of them asked me, I finally got up the nerves to ask him what he does and try to start a conversation. It turned out that he's a freelance audio designer, but he worked for multiple different companies before going off on his own. Because of this he knows a ton of people and after talking about the projects I'm working on now, he was more than willing to drag me around the conference introducing me to people.</p>
<h4>Spritebuilder</h4>
<p>While wandering around the expo floor, I saw a poster for something called Spritebuilder. Underneath the name it claimed to be an open source game development suite. After delving into open source software in the past year or so I was interested in seeing more about it. One of their developers was showing it to me and we talked about it being open source. The developer told me it's base code is a project called Cocos2d which was already an open source project. So naturally they followed in it's footsteps. The development software itself looks to be a mixture of Flash and Unity specifically for iOS development. I can't wait to have time to play around with it more and see what I can and can't do with it.</p>
<h4>Blizzard Programmer Panel</h4>
<p>In the middle of the day the Blizzard University Relations team had an organized panel focusing on programming. The panel was made up of people from most of the different teams within Blizzard, as well as having people of all different levels within the company. They had a lot of good information, and pretty much everyone asked good questions. Afterwards most of the Blizzard employees who were there stuck around to answer more questions and talk to people. I of course talked about WoW Diabetes. A couple of times the response was that they didn't work on the WoW team, but I took a chance and replied, but you probably play some WoW.</p>
<h4>Early Night</h4>
<p>After a couple more hours of walking around and talking with people, I decided to call it an early night. I spent some time working on a bit of homework, then played some games before getting to sleep early. After having stayed up late Sunday through Tuesday I figured it was a good idea to get some extra rest so I could be refreshed for the rest of the week.</p>
