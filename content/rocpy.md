At the RocPy meetup there was a gentleman who was practicing giving a talk before he goes in front of a large group of people to give the same talk. The talk is over a program built for use in astronomy, but also open enough to be able to use for other things. It's called Toyz and you can see the code for it [here](https://github.com/fred3m/toyz).

Apparently most of the software that astronomers currently use is extremely old and while it still functions, doesn't have a lot of different features that would be useful. One of the features that he showed off are the ability to create multiple types of graphs from the same data set, pick a point on one graph and see it on all of the others.
