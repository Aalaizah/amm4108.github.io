My guild has been using an out of date add-on called Master Loot Manager Remix. It hadn't been updated since one of the early Mists of Pandaria Patches. While we were using it, we noticed that, becuase of when it was last updated, it had no way of dealing with awarding loot to characters who are on a different server from yours. I was able to add a rudimentary way of doing this. I would definitely like to change the way the code is done to make it so that I feel like its better code. I'm not currently sure what else I'm going to add to the project just yet, but I'm willing to commit some time to making something that's useful for more people than just my guild.
