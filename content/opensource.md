#### The Gist
Defining how and why open source projects work is a very complicated matter. It doesn't follow the normal programming flow. It is fairly impossible to know how many people contribute to the open source community, or to know those peoples motivations.

#### The Good
1. I like the use of she for the pronoun instead of having a majority of hes throughout.
2. There are a decent number of graphs to help show data as they talk about it.
3. It compares code to both poetry and midieval architectures.

#### The Bad
1. Instead of the footnotes being at the bottom of the pages it seems they're all at the end of the book.
2. It really bothers me that the author will start talking about something and then say he'll talk more about it in a different chapter.
3. Extremely in-depth, sometimes too much so.

#### The Questions
1. Why were VA Linux and Red Hat Software so successful out of the gate on Wall Street?
2. If Brooke's Law is true, why are there so many extremely large programming teams? Wouldn't it make more sense to have smaller teams?
3. Where did the term hostile forking originate?

#### The Review
If you're new in the land of open source, this text contains a lot of useful knowledge about the history of open source and open source communities.
Half a dozen red roses.
