- How will you communicate with them? (i.e. IRC Channel, Email Addresss, mail lists, issue trackers, etc...)
	- Both email and IRC

- What are the easy parts?
	- Coming up with ideas to implement
	- Understanding basic angle measurements

- What are the hard parts?
	- Creating a game that’s in a language that isn’t familiar for all of us for a limited hardware.
	- Ensuring that the educational goal is achieved while still entertaining and engaging the user


- How will you overcome both?
	- Learn as much of the language as possible before actually starting to program the game up. 
	- Collating all of our ideas into a single document where we can decide what’s feasible and set timelines
