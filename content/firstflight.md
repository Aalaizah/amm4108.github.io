For the first flight assignment I had most of it already set up from a previous course. I did however get to take the chance to figure out how Ghost deals with RSS feeds. After a certain number of posts it cuts it off and adds another page. One way of dealing with this is to do the feed by tags. This is accomplished by adding /tag/thetagused/rss - thetagused being whatever tag you want the feed to be associated with.
