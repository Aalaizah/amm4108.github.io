Right now we're working towards adding a website portion to the WoW Diabetes add-on. Luckily I'm not having to work on the website itself, as it might not turn out super great if I were. Instead I'm figuring out a way to get a string that can be copied and pasted into the website so that the website can get some data about your usage of this specific add-on. 

Another add-on that I use does this specific thing as well. So for the next few days that code and I are going to be best friends. Until I think I can reliably do the same thing I'm going to read and re-read their code that does it.
