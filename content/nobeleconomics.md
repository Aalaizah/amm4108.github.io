#### The Gist
This article is a quick summary of the 2014 Nobel Prize in economics, which included research that showed earlier research may be true for some cases but isn't true for others.

#### The Good
1. He addressed oligopolies which isn't talked about very often.
2. He proved that game theory can be important outside of the realm of games.
3. It's a fairly short read.

#### The Bad
1. It needs more useful visualizations.
2. It could use some examples.
3. It didn't seem to have much really about code.

#### The Questions
1.
2.
3.

#### Your Review
This article was an interesting read, however it was very short and could have benefited greatly from examples and visualizations that were meaningful. It didn't really have anything to do with code other than the game theory mention.
