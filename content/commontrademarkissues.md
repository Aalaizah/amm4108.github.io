#### The Gist
This contains a general overview of Trademarks. You shouldn't try to trademark a generic name such as "music player". Unlike with patents, you should search Trademarks, including things that are unregistered. Registering yours give you stronger protection that not.

#### The Good
1. They're very clear you should seek profession advice if needed.
2. Extremely thourough amounts of information, such as pricing.
3. Unlike in the Patents, they gave a clear example when talking about giving permission for outside people to use a trademark.

#### The Bad
1. There's no examples for what might count as a specimen outside of what the USPTO requires.
2. This chapter didn't speak at all to laws outside of the US and how that might affect software projects.
3. It ends.

#### The Questions
1. Who gets to decide that genericide has happened.
2. Do you have to pay more money to update your mark?
3. What defines a thorough search?
