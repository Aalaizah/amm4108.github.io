<p>The last day was short, both in how long I was at the conference, and in how long it was open. I walked around the expo floor for a little bit, and ran into the CA I had met before the production roundtable. After that I went to a second production roundtable. This one had many more people and was about managing and motivating people.</p>
<h4>Lunch and Exploration</h4>
<p>After the production roundtable I played some Tumblestone until it was time to meet up with some RIT people and some new friends for some lunch. We walked around San Francisco some, playing a game where when you come to an intersection you cross the street in whichever direction turns green first. Even though we didn't really do much besides walk around, it was a nice way to destress before heading back to the cold insanity that is Rochester.</p>
