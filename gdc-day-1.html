<p>I had the awesome opportunity to go to E3 this past summer. I thought having that experience under my belt would help me deal with the shear number of people around here. I was insanely wrong. As the day has gone on it's gotten slightly better. I spent a lot of time hanging with the people who were running a little game corner called the Wheel of Whimsy. </p>
<h4>Meeting People</h4>
<p>I did meet a couple of people, someone who graduated with a 3D animation degree, but loves gaming and wants to break into the industry. I also met an awesome gentleman who does content production for a company that works for the DOD. I also met a man who was trying to do a report on GDC this year, and was taking quotes for the Facebook based newspaper he works, you can read it at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152941545385817.1073743432.171020735816&amp;type=1">SFNews.US</a></p>
