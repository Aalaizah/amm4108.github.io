</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Before starting to work on FOSS projects, and definitely before starting this course, I didn't comprehend the ways that Copyright laws and others could hurt a project. I had only ever really seen the ways that they helped people, most of these are dependant upon money, or occasionally just a point of authorship. That's all well and good, but this course has really opened my eyes to how these types of laws can work against creativity. It's also really surprising to me that with the amount of importance the American culture seems to put on being creative, the laws currently actively work against that culture.</p>
