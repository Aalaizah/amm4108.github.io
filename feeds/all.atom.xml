I'm using it to learn more about the language C++ but also to learn more about how my programming choices affect the computer, such as where things are being stored in memory. While learning is one of the most important parts of this project, completing the game is important as well. I've started laying out the different classes I will need to make the game as well as the different types of functions I'll need in each class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="learncpp.com"&gt;Learning C++&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While looking for resources to learn C++ I came across a website that not only has a lot of information about C++, but also has a ton of other more basic information for programming. I've started working my way through this website, which is laid out like a web based book. At the end of each chapter there is a comprehensive quiz that covers most of what was talked about throughout the chapter, along with the answers so you can make sure you did it correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Learning Data Structures &amp;amp; Algorithms(DSA)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I've spent most of my time diving into C++ so I can get a good grasp of the differences between it and other languages I've used a lot of, I'm also getting started with DSA. I've borrowed a couple of different books that cover these topics and will be starting to read through them in the next couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="HFOSS"></category><category term="BizLeg"></category><category term="GameChallenge"></category></entry><entry><title>Profile 2 - CodeCombat</title><link href="/profile-2-codecombat.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-04-02T14:13:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Alexandria Mack</name></author><id>tag:,2015-04-02:profile-2-codecombat.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h4&gt;Rationale&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CodeCombat is something that hits home for me. It’s a game that teaches how to code. And from what I’ve played of it, it seems to be a good game. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;http://blog.codecombat.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Community Architecture&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The goal of this project is create a game where kids can learn to code while completing levels. It’s not meant to teach you to be an engineer, but to teach you how to intensively practice the programming fundamentals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latest commit was 10 hours ago (as of 1/2/15 9:30am)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who approves patches? How many people?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://i.imgur.com/J1id9Yx.png&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted? How many total?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://i.imgur.com/J1id9Yx.png&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The project has two lead developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No they are different people. It looks like on the core team it’s pretty even. But as far as other contributors it’s hard to tell. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is the project's participation trending and why?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trending up. They’ve had a lot of active users, especially with the trend of trying to get young students into STEM fields. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would hope so, there are a ton of active developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probably not. the most active 20% are people who are employed to create this game. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place? (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://codecombat.com/contribute &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if you’re learning how to code, there are other things that you can contribute to.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://codecombat.com/cla &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive? Does it include code examples?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yes to both  https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Component &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Message anyone their hipchat. Or create an issue on github.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group? Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;barely contained chaos, there are over 200 issues. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would enjoy working in this. I work really well in chaotic situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Technology/Product (Section adapted from EFF Worksheet)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shannon Valor is a Philosphy professor who is also trying to kick Silicon Valley into shape. Currently, most app and software development is much more about the business behind it and making money, instead of being about the user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Terminology&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest issues that she sees is the use of the word user. Instead of thinking about the users as people, they are just thought of as a number. This has lead to a lot of companies, such as Twitter, to not really realize how important it is when people are using these platforms in ways that were unintentional, such as abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Open Source&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it would be awesome for open source platforms and projects to start being more ethical in both their communities and their development practices, Dr. Vallor believes its much more important for the big name companies to make these changes. It will be something that can then trickle down into the smaller companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Community Architecture&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The unfortunately named "Eclipse Project" is the project dedicated to producing the Eclipse SDK. This name made sense back when there were only two or three projects at Eclipse, but now it is frequently referred to as the "Eclipse top-level project" to reduce confusion (or just "The Platform" when we're feeling grandiose).  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most recent release was on June 26, 2013.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The initial Commit was in 2003.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who approves patches? How many people?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;https://eclipse.org/eclipse/team-leaders.php - These people each are responibile for a section of the project. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted? How many total?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PMC Leads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike Wilson has been at Eclipse since it’s founding. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone is responsible for QA and bugs. every project has a bug forum where everyone can post and contribute to bug fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is the project's participation trending and why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not? &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think it would pass the Raptor Test. There is a hoard of people behind Mike Wilson, and while he will be missed, i’m sure someone could step up to be the team lead. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not? &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development would obviously be a little halted, but I believe it would be able to continue. Eclipse is backed by many big name companies, like IBM. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place? (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New contributors would most likely not start on the top-level project. They should start on one of the many subprojects. For Example, a subproject Orion has a very extensive new-contributor guide and lots of quick starts. http://wiki.eclipse.org/Orion/Getting_the_source http://wiki.eclipse.org/Orion/Getting_Started_with_Orion &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive? Does it include code examples?
    http://www.eclipse.org/documentation/ &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how? &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re on a sub-project, the developers are very active on their IRC channels. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group? Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hierarchical. Sub groups approve what patches get sent to the higher up groups, and the higher up groups determine what gets patched into the main project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Technology/Product (Section adapted from EFF Worksheet)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Eclipse Foundation was created in Feb. 2004 with a reorganization of the Eclipse Consortium. The Consortium had sponsors of HP, IBM, MontaVista, Intel, QNX Software Systems, SAP, and Serena Software. Today, the Eclipse Foundation’s sponsors are Actuate,     IBM, Oracle, SAP, CA Inc and Google.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the technology designed to do? How is it used?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Eclipse Foundation was created to be the steward of the Eclipse IDE and software development environment. The foundation was works to create new technologies that work with or compliment Eclipse. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who would benefit from using this technology?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any developers looking to make plug-ins for Eclipse, software that uses Eclipse or reach the large audience that uses the IDE would want to work with the foundation to integrate well into the Eclipse ecosystem. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kinds of companies or organizations (stakeholders) might have been concerned about the development of this technology? Why?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the technology is an old IBM project that is now open source, IBM cares deeply about the project as they started it in a way. Google’s mobile operating system, Android uses Java as its base language and many Java developers work in Eclipse, so Google is also interested in the well being of the IDE and thus the foundation. 
Does/Did an aspect of copyright law play a role in controversies about the technology? How? There weren’t any issues that our team could find relating to copyright law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;When&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Gist&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is a quick summary of the 2014 Nobel Prize in economics, which included research that showed earlier research may be true for some cases but isn't true for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Good&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He addressed oligopolies which isn't talked about very often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He proved that game theory can be important outside of the realm of games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's a fairly short read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Bad&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It needs more useful visualizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It could use some examples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It didn't seem to have much really about code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Questions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.
2.
3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Your Review&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article was an interesting read, however it was very short and could have benefited greatly from examples and visualizations that were meaningful. It didn't really have anything to do with code other than the game theory mention.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Originally released in 2003 but has seen many updates with the latest being in 2014&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last "Updated" in 2014&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Gist&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies can use GPL'd software throughout a company without having to worry about anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are advantages and disadvantages from most of the different business perspectives. There are four "known" business models for open source money making: Support sellers, loss leader, widget frosting, and accessorizing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Good&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's short and to the point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPL'd Software can be shared throughout a company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While it's not often advertised to the regular consumer, there are a lot of big name products that are open source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Bad&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While it being short is nice, it also means theres not a lot of substance or explanation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples are out of date. While it's nice to have them in there, if the people reading it don't know what the example is, it's not very helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This really only deals with the theoretical, and the theoretical isn't always how things pan out in practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Questions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are other licenses dealt with when trying to use them for company purposes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are these all of the possible FOSS business models that are in use? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we show companies that FOSS isn't necessarily a bad thing? That you can make money off of it and it might actually make your product better?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Review&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using GPL'd Software is a short and sweet section of what is potentially a great book. It offers an interesting piece of information without bogging the reader down in too much unneeded info.
6 Red Roses and 6 White Roses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OSI Business Model is a much longer read. While it has some really good information, there is a lot that is outdated. It has broken links and examples that not everyone will have heard of.

&lt;h4&gt;When&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 4, 2008&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Gist&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chapter provides a brief overview of organizational issues, and how you might go about choosing if you want to create your own organization for your project or try to join another organization with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Good&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reiteration that this is not legal advice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple to read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has a seemingly straightforward guide to incorporating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Bad&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This chapter just addresses the legal issues of having an organization and not any of the social ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The information in this chapter is even more localized than the other chapters, dealing mostly with New York's requirements when other chapters talked about the entire US.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There still aren't really any examples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Questions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why are digital board meetings not counted as the same as a board meeting in person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some examples of different successful open source organizations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does dealing with incorporating or other organizational things when not all of the developers are from a single country?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Review&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chapter contains a lot of good, although basic, information about how to become a corporation if needed. It also talks about some of the different reasons that you may or may not want to do so. Over all it is a very generalized chapter, and only goes into some specifics, such as how NY state deals with out of state corporations.

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will you communicate with them? (i.e. IRC Channel, Email Addresss, mail lists, issue trackers, etc...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both email and IRC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the easy parts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coming up with ideas to implement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding basic angle measurements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the hard parts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a game that’s in a language that isn’t familiar for all of us for a limited hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensuring that the educational goal is achieved while still entertaining and engaging the user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will you overcome both?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn as much of the language as possible before actually starting to program the game up. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collating all of our ideas into a single document where we can decide what’s feasible and set timelines&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They mostly use their mailing list to talk to the public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your subject organize or participate in any conferences? If so, list them here, and provide links to any relevant sessions, keynotes, or content. &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drupal participates in and hosts a multitude of events ranging from user group meetings to their own convention. All of the upcoming events can be found at https://groups.drupal.org/events?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The project's IRC Channel: #drupal, #drupal-contribute, #drupal-support are the main channels. There’s also a long list of topic channels at https://www.drupal.org/irc. They’re all on freenode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source Code repository : http://git.drupal.org/project/drupal.git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mail list archive: Archives are set up separately. They can be found at https://www.drupal.org/mailing-lists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation : All of the documentation is found at https://www.drupal.org/documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project Website and/or Blog: Website at https://www.drupal.org/, blog at https://www.drupal.org/planet, the blog is an aggregate of multiple blogs having to do with drupal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Community Architecture&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Drupal is a content management system which allows you to create and maintain many different types of websites without needing to know any coding languages.” taken from https://www.drupal.org/documentation/understand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It began as a message board in 1999. When more people became interested, the project became open source. The original commit for the project was May 14, 2000. The latest February 21, 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who approves patches? How many people?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Currently Dries Buytaert, Nathaniel Catchpole, Alex Pott, and Angela Byron make up the team of reviewers. The contributions are peer reviewed and then decided on by Dries or another of the core committers. Anyone can submit patches against Drupal core. https://www.drupal.org/node/21778&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted? How many total? &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main reviewers are the only ones who have commit access. There are 37,610 people are counted as developers for the entire project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There has been a lot of turnover for each successive version. Dries has always been among these people but the branch maintainers have changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dries Buytaert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the most part they are different developers, because it’s broken out into different projects. Drupal Core is the back-end for it and the front end is constantly updating when new people make new themes for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is the project's participation trending and why?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently participation has been trending downwards, but it looks like it’s because the project is in an extremely stable state right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, while he’s definitely a major contributor, there’s a ton of documentation, and there’s an active development community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think the project would survive, but development would definitely slow down. There is a ton of documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place? (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, they have a page in their community section that is specifically about getting involved. It talks about multiple different ways you can do this. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive? Does it include code examples?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drupal has very extensive documentation. Quickly glancing through I couldn’t find any code examples, but there are links to a lot of other places you can look for help from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first thing I would do is hop into their IRC channel and ask people there. If the people who are there couldn’t help then I’d head over to their forums at https://www.drupal.org/forum and seek additional help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group? Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is currently a mix of hierarchical and ruled by a small group. While Dries Buytaert has the ultimate say in pretty much everything, there is a group of people who also help him make his decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I normally work better in a more chaotic environment, but I could see myself putting out some decent work in this sort of structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the technology designed to do? How is it used?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who would benefit from using this technology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kinds of companies or organizations (stakeholders) might have been concerned about the development of this technology? Why?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last day was short, both in how long I was at the conference, and in how long it was open. I walked around the expo floor for a little bit, and ran into the CA I had met before the production roundtable. After that I went to a second production roundtable. This one had many more people and was about managing and motivating people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Lunch and Exploration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the production roundtable I played some Tumblestone until it was time to meet up with some RIT people and some new friends for some lunch. We walked around San Francisco some, playing a game where when you come to an intersection you cross the street in whichever direction turns green first. Even though we didn't really do much besides walk around, it was a nice way to destress before heading back to the cold insanity that is Rochester.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="BizLeg"></category><category term="HFOSS"></category><category term="GameChallenge"></category></entry><entry><title>Teen Dating Violence - Life.Change.Game Challenge</title><link href="/teen-dating-violence-lifechangegame-challenge.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-03-21T22:05:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Alexandria Mack</name></author><id>tag:,2015-03-21:teen-dating-violence-lifechangegame-challenge.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h4&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently found a new game challenge that I'd like to participate in. The idea behind the challenge is to help teach about teen dating violence. This year the challenge is to create a game about teen dating violence without any violence in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;My Idea&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I only have a basic idea for what I want to do for this project. I know I want to make a visual novel style game, and have it take place throughout the four different years of high school. As part of the rules for the challenge there has to be an online portion to the game, so I'm thinking of trying to implement something along the same lines as what TellTale Games does for there's. They basically track each players major choices and show where you are in comparison with the rest of the world. I'm going to be using Twine2Unity as the basis for my project and will hopefully be able to clean up that code some as well throughout this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="BizLeg"></category><category term="HFOSS"></category></entry><entry><title>Master Loot Manager Remix 2!!!</title><link href="/master-loot-manager-remix-2.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-03-21T21:53:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Alexandria Mack</name></author><id>tag:,2015-03-21:master-loot-manager-remix-2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My guild has been using an out of date add-on called Master Loot Manager Remix. It hadn't been updated since one of the early Mists of Pandaria Patches. While we were using it, we noticed that, becuase of when it was last updated, it had no way of dealing with awarding loot to characters who are on a different server from yours. I was able to add a rudimentary way of doing this. I would definitely like to change the way the code is done to make it so that I feel like its better code. I'm not currently sure what else I'm going to add to the project just yet, but I'm willing to commit some time to making something that's useful for more people than just my guild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;What are the similarities between Weber's eight principles, and the five pillars?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Weber's eight principles and the five pillars contain a lot about the importance of the community. They also both talk about how things should be moving rapidly. 
4. What are the differences?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general principles goes into much more detail about each of the different principals. It also spaces things out so they can talk more about things to think about when starting a project. 
5. Bonus: Who's "keen analysis" did Weber "Draw Heavily" upon?"
  Eric S. Raymond
6. Double-Bonus: What was the title of this "keen analysis." (Hint: Weber hinted at the title when he was talking about Cathedrals earlier in the chapter.)
  The Cathedral &amp;amp; the Bazaar

&lt;p&gt;I've been trying to add in the things I will need to be able to export stats to our website and then be able to import them back in if the player needs it. I've tried a few different ways of doing things, but most of them have ended in an error where something that should exist through the Blizzard UI doesn't exist. All of these errors made the game itself unplayable while my add-on was running, a couple of times the errors I was getting made it so I had to do a hard reload in order to reset the add-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;I Think I fixed it!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After looking through not only some other add-ons but also some of Blizzard's UI code, I found something that seems to be working. There aren't any runtime/compiler errors, but I also haven't finished implementing everything. As I move in to spring break I will hopefully get the last of it implemented and running so that as soon as the website is fully functional we can go live with that update.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="HFOSS"></category><category term="BizLeg"></category></entry><entry><title>Curriculum</title><link href="/curriculum.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-03-18T16:50:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Alexandria Mack</name></author><id>tag:,2015-03-18:curriculum.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h4&gt;Interests and the Boring parts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The geometry unit 4.G, and the geometric measurement portion of 4.MD are units that interest me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unit 4.MD other than the geometric measuring portion is uninteresting for me. The operations in base 10 from 4.NBT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geometric Measurement 4.MD Ideas&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An alligator who has to open it's mouth to at least a certain angle to eat different objects&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have 2 conveyor belts if it's too big for the alligator to eat you have to move it to the one that doesn't lead to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lose points if you open too far(to prevent people from just always opening all the way)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A player starts at the origin and has to turn to what angle they think will be large enough to avoid an object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geometry Unit 4.G Ideas&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move your character around a shape to show the line of symmetry.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which Entity did your team choose to profile?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eclipse Foundation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description of the Organization?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Eclipse Foundation was created in January 2004 as an&lt;br /&gt;
independent not-for-profit corporation to act as the steward of the Eclipse&lt;br /&gt;
community. The independent not-for-profit corporation was created to allow a vendor&lt;br /&gt;
neutral and open, transparent community to be established around Eclipse.” -&lt;a href="http://eclipse.org/org/"&gt;http://eclipse.org/org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description of the project?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Eclipse is a community for individuals and organizations&lt;br /&gt;
who wish to collaborate on commercially-friendly open source software. Its&lt;br /&gt;
projects are focused on building an open development platform comprised of&lt;br /&gt;
extensible frameworks, tools and runtimes for building, deploying and managing&lt;br /&gt;
software across the lifecycle.” -&lt;a href="http://eclipse.org/org/"&gt;http://eclipse.org/org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Describe each team member's role?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andrew: Writing this team proposal, creating the draft and final version of the presentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: Research data for research paper, write paper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Katie: Reseach data for research paper, write paper&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will you communicate with them? (i.e. IRC Channel, Email Addresss, mail lists, issue&lt;br /&gt;
trackers, etc...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their website has a large forum, links to IRC channels they host, and their mailing lists. These will be used when needed information is hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you anticipate the easy parts will be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding the structure of organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where its projects are used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interacting with the community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you anticipate the hard parts will be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding all the projects in the Eclipse Foundation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding the differences in the their open source licenses and other open source licenses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding the History of the Eclipse Foundation and how it differs from the Eclipse organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will you overcome both?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After grabbing breakfast, I introduced a friend to an ex-coworker, hopefully starting a conversation for an internship position. We then made our way over to the Razer booth to talk to them and try to get in their development program for their fitness band. In order to get in you were supposed to prove that you have some mobile development chops, but I started talking Twine2Unity, which my only mobile stuff and the guy got extremely excited that somebody was doing something interesting with Twine. I then wandered around and talked to people about what they're currently developing and getting some awesome new shirts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Anti-Social Behavior Talk&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting some new swag and talking to developers trying to learn as much as I can, I went to a talk about how design enforces anti-social behavior. It was given by a researcher who has talked to different companies who have recognized that their games have toxic communities. Even though it's hard to design in a way that rewards good behavior without adding to the punishment of the toxic players, it's extremely important to start thinking about it. The earlier we as developers can start iterating on ideas, the quicker we can try and get the problem fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Production Round Table&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After wandering around more, and talking with some companies in the career fair I went to a production round table. It was down at the end of what looked like a mostly unused hallway. When I walked down there one of the CA's asked if I was lost, but I just wanted to get their early in case there were a lot of people. After that we started talking, she got extremely excited because she was coming off shift and is wanting to get into production. It started off as a conversation more about how to get into production, which was cool for those of us who are trying to get in. We then moved into more of a discussion around getting better at your job, or just general advice for producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were definitely some interesting conversations going on both during and afterwards. One of the people who was there is a Senior Producer at Blizzard(World of Warcraft), and another is a producer from CCP(Eve Online). After, the producer from CCP had a bunch of questions for the guy from Blizzard. He was trying to learn as much as he can so he can try to bring new things back to his company to make them more successful. I wanted to learn as much as I can to help jump start my career. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After their conversation about how both studios deal with production the guy from Blizzard and I started talking. I talked about my Diabetes add-on, which he seemed extremely interested in, and then we started talking about career advice, and the fact that I was about to be headed to the Blizzard recruitment mixer came up. He told me I should say hi to a specific lady for him when I got there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Blizzard Mixer&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I made it to the bar that the Mixer was supposed to be at, there was a giant line going down the block and then around the corner. I walked back to where a couple of my friends for waiting for me, and where they were talking with some other friends as well. I ended up speaking with some really interesting people while waiting in line to get in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finally getting in, I asked for the Lady that the Blizzard producer had told me to say hi for and found her really quickly. We had an interesting conversation about why I had a lanyard indicating that I wanted to be a programmer but had met the producer at a production roundtable. She then told me that I should talk to a specific programmer who was somewhere in the back of the bar and found someone to lead me back to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was in the middle of a conversation with another developer about what he does as a lead and to me it sounded like he has become more of a producer than a programmer, but he was still able to talk programming with me. I had learned earlier in the week that the UI/UX team and Gameplay programming team use the same API that add-on developers have access to, just with some extra protected functions. I asked him about that - about what it was like to be using something that seems more like it was created with add-on developers in mind, and he said while at times it was annoying, it makes a lot of sense. A lot of the different portions of the game are basically just add-ons that are loaded when the player gets within a certain range of where they would be interacting with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that first conversation the rest of the night was me being whirlwinded around and being introduced to a bunch of people or just walking up and introducing myself to people. Which overall was a ton of fun.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="BizLeg"></category><category term="HFOSS"></category><category term="GameChallenge"></category></entry><entry><title>Team Proposal 0 - Acqulia/Drupal</title><link href="/team-proposal-0-acquliadrupal.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-03-15T13:50:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Alexandria Mack</name></author><id>tag:,2015-03-15:team-proposal-0-acquliadrupal.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Questions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Describe software project, its purpose and goals.&lt;/strong&gt;
“Pyramid is a very general open source Python web framework. As a framework, its primary job is to make it easier for a developer to create an arbitrary web application. The type of application being created isn’t really important; it could be a spreadsheet, a corporate intranet, or a social networking platform. Pyramid is general enough that it can be used in a wide variety of circumstances.”([Pyramid About Page])(http://www.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/about)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?&lt;/strong&gt;
The project started out as BFG or repoze.bfg. This was started in June, 2008. In December of 2010, when Pylons was started, it became Pyramid. Some features were removed and other were removed when this happened. The latest commit(as of this writing) was March 13, 2015&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Who approves patches? How many people?&lt;/strong&gt;
The Pylons developers approve patches. They don’t seem to talk about a more in depth answer, but according to GitHub there are 4 people who have pushed commits to the main repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?&lt;/strong&gt;
Four people have commit access. Steve Piercy, Russell Ballestrini, Junya Hayashi, and Eric Parent. There are 100 contributors listed on the GitHub repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Who has the highest amounts of "Unique Knowledge?" (As per your "Git-by-a-bus" report. If there is a tie, list each contributor, with links if possible)&lt;/strong&gt;
Chris McDonough&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. What is your project's "Calloway Coefficient of Fail?"&lt;/strong&gt;
30-60 points of FAIL: Babies cry when your code is downloaded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the same top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)&lt;/strong&gt;
Since October 10th, 2011, Chris McDonough or Mcdonc came around, it changed from the “Mighty Python Framework” to the “Python Web Framework”. Out of a total 8,139 commits, he’s done 2,443 of them. Git_by_a_bus showed him to be a part of 7,747 of the 12,799 files in python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)&lt;/strong&gt;
Chris McDonough or Mcdonc, see previous answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?&lt;/strong&gt;
There is no real front end developers as Pyramid uses several templating engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?&lt;/strong&gt;
After browsing github’s issue history, Michael Merickel or mmerickel appears to be the foremost bug repairer. Out of the last 38 bugs, he has either opened, closed, or commented on 24 of them. The bugs seem to arise when a new version is released, a new feature is tested, or when they attempt to get a new feature to work on windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. How is the project's participation trending and why?&lt;/strong&gt;
Number of commits is going down recently as Pyramid is very stable right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?&lt;/strong&gt;
It does not pass the raptor test, Chris McDonough puts out more code than the next 19 combined. Someone else might pick up the reigns, but it would surely change as much as it did when he joined in October 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13. In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?&lt;/strong&gt;
I dunno, probably not. I think I would work on the project then with Ryan Brown and we’ll fix it up. Of the 7th top developer and lesser developers, no one does work on more than 80 files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14. Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place? (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)&lt;/strong&gt;
If you’re a major contributor, then yes. More info at http://www.pylonsproject.org/community/how-to-contribute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15. Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive? Does it include code examples?&lt;/strong&gt;
Yes. Yes. Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16. If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?&lt;/strong&gt;
I would contact Ryan Brown by Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17. Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?&lt;/strong&gt;
Rules by a small group of six people who are all major contributors and comment on patches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18. Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?&lt;/strong&gt;
I don't know enough Python to feel comfortable working on a major Pyton project. However if I did know more Python I would be okay working on a project like this one.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="HFOSS"></category></entry><entry><title>Team Proposal - Pyramid</title><link href="/team-proposal-pyramid.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-03-09T15:58:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Alexandria Mack</name></author><id>tag:,2015-03-09:team-proposal-pyramid.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which project did your team choose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We chose Pyramid, the Python web framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2-liner description of the project?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pyramid is a Python web framework that has great integration with several open source projects that work well together to give a complete solution to writing a web app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will each team member's role be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Julien - Assigned to do Calloway’s Coefficent of Fail and answer the questions for that segment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex - Assigned to do the main questions in the document going over the projects general workflow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fernando - Assigned to do Git-by-a-bus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will add more or change what the roles are down the line once we see how much work each section is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source Code Repository URL?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Chris McDonough&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#99;&amp;#104;&amp;#114;&amp;#105;&amp;#115;&amp;#109;&amp;#64;&amp;#112;&amp;#108;&amp;#111;&amp;#112;&amp;#101;&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;"&gt;&amp;#99;&amp;#104;&amp;#114;&amp;#105;&amp;#115;&amp;#109;&amp;#64;&amp;#112;&amp;#108;&amp;#111;&amp;#112;&amp;#101;&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will you communicate with them? (i.e. IRC Channel, Email Addresss, mail lists, issue trackers, etc...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the easy parts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calloway’s Coefficient of Fail should be pretty easy as Pyramid has always been a good example of open source Python work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of Pyramid’s dev pipeline is written well so it should be easy to talk about how the projects innards work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the hard parts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing Git by a Bus properly will be hard as there are multiple sub projects of Pyramid and we will have to collect all of the results together. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will you overcome both?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’ll compile a list of core parts of Pyramid like SQLAlchemy and then try to run Git-by-a-bus on all of them. We’ll then try and look at the results between all the projects and look committers that are the same between them. Once we find committers that are the same between them, we’ll try to adjust our results to reflect that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting coffee this morning turned into me pitching WoW Diabetes to a WoW dev.  Apparently they have a list of things they do when they need a break or are extra stressed, and he added this to the list. I can't wait to keep working on this and start really polishing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Audio Designer and More Coffee&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While waiting for the Expo floor to open I was standing near the line for one of the coffee places inside the convention center, I was asked multiple times if I was in line as well. When one of them asked me, I finally got up the nerves to ask him what he does and try to start a conversation. It turned out that he's a freelance audio designer, but he worked for multiple different companies before going off on his own. Because of this he knows a ton of people and after talking about the projects I'm working on now, he was more than willing to drag me around the conference introducing me to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Spritebuilder&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While wandering around the expo floor, I saw a poster for something called Spritebuilder. Underneath the name it claimed to be an open source game development suite. After delving into open source software in the past year or so I was interested in seeing more about it. One of their developers was showing it to me and we talked about it being open source. The developer told me it's base code is a project called Cocos2d which was already an open source project. So naturally they followed in it's footsteps. The development software itself looks to be a mixture of Flash and Unity specifically for iOS development. I can't wait to have time to play around with it more and see what I can and can't do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Blizzard Programmer Panel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the day the Blizzard University Relations team had an organized panel focusing on programming. The panel was made up of people from most of the different teams within Blizzard, as well as having people of all different levels within the company. They had a lot of good information, and pretty much everyone asked good questions. Afterwards most of the Blizzard employees who were there stuck around to answer more questions and talk to people. I of course talked about WoW Diabetes. A couple of times the response was that they didn't work on the WoW team, but I took a chance and replied, but you probably play some WoW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Early Night&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple more hours of walking around and talking with people, I decided to call it an early night. I spent some time working on a bit of homework, then played some games before getting to sleep early. After having stayed up late Sunday through Tuesday I figured it was a good idea to get some extra rest so I could be refreshed for the rest of the week.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="BizLeg"></category><category term="HFOSS"></category><category term="GameChallenge"></category></entry><entry><title>GDC Day 2</title><link href="/gdc-day-2.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-03-08T13:58:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Alexandria Mack</name></author><id>tag:,2015-03-08:gdc-day-2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h4&gt;Random Talking&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today has been so much better. I guess I just needed some time to get used to having so many people around. I got the chance to talk to a lot of fun people. There weren't any talks that sounded interesting, so instead I mostly just walked around and said hi to as many people as I could. I also took the time to go play one of the board games in the table top lounge. I looked at what all games they had, and while I wish I had taken the time to play the XCOM board game, I really enjoyed the game I did play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mascarade&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mascarade is a board game that doesn't use a board. You have a bunch of different cards that represent different roles. The roles that are in play for each game are dependent on how many players are playing. The different roles have different abilities that help players reach their goal. Each player starts with six gold and the point of the game is to get to thirteen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a players turn you can take one of three actions: you can swap your role card with another players(under the table so no one knows which role you kept), you can look at your card(so you know who you are), or you can announce who you are and use your ability. If somebody thinks/knows you're lying about who you are they can clame to be that person, at which point both players flip over their roles. If both players are different roles from the one claimed, they pay a one gold penalty, otherwise whichever player was incorrect pays the penalty and the other player gets to activate the ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winning this game requires a lot of paying attention to what's going on, which may not have been one of the best things to play at a conference where you want to talk and meet people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Christine Love&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw Christine just standing around talking while I was in the Indie Megabooth. I sort of geeked out and didn't know what to say. Her writing is amazing, and I can't wait to see what she has in store with her next game. I also got to talk with her about Twine2Unity, a parser I've been working on with a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sha of Happiness&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got to meet the Sha of Happiness. She created a roleplaying Twitter account based on an idea from the World of Warcraft. Throughout her time on Twitter, she's gone back and forth on whether or not she's roleplaying. She's spent some of her time talking about depression and how she deals with it, which in turn has helped me deal with learning to deal with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had asked her if we could meet up, but I definitely wasn't expecting to see her when I did. It was only a few minutes after running into Christine Love and I was still shaking with excitement. It took everything I had not to run over in excitement when I recognized her. We sat and talked for awhile, and then ended up getting ice cream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm extremely glad that I got the opportunity to meet her in person, and I really hope that we can have more interactions. She is an amazingly friendly person, and she's willing to stand up and fight for what she believes in. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="BizLeg"></category><category term="HFOSS"></category><category term="GameChallenge"></category></entry><entry><title>GDC Day 1</title><link href="/gdc-day-1.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-03-03T00:46:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Alexandria Mack</name></author><id>tag:,2015-03-03:gdc-day-1.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h4&gt;Stress and Over Saturation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the awesome opportunity to go to E3 this past summer. I thought having that experience under my belt would help me deal with the shear number of people around here. I was insanely wrong. As the day has gone on it's gotten slightly better. I spent a lot of time hanging with the people who were running a little game corner called the Wheel of Whimsy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Meeting People&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did meet a couple of people, someone who graduated with a 3D animation degree, but loves gaming and wants to break into the industry. I also met an awesome gentleman who does content production for a company that works for the DOD. I also met a man who was trying to do a report on GDC this year, and was taking quotes for the Facebook based newspaper he works, you can read it at &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152941545385817.1073743432.171020735816&amp;amp;type=1"&gt;SFNews.US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="BizLeg"></category><category term="HFOSS"></category><category term="GameChallenge"></category></entry><entry><title>Scaling in WoW Diabetes</title><link href="/scaling-in-wow-diabetes.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-03-01T00:28:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Alexandria Mack</name></author><id>tag:,2015-03-01:scaling-in-wow-diabetes.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Scaling the add-on for when it's being used in activities other than questing has been an interesting journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that when you spend a lot of time in combat, such as during a raid encounter, and even during bosses in the 5-man dungeons it feels extremely punishing. And while the add-on is meant to simulate having diabetes in real life, it’s also important that it’s still fun to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first proposed to the other designer and my project lead that we needed some sort of scaling, one of the major ideas was to have the food affect you a little bit differently as your level increased. I looked into this a little bit, but the issue came more from the change in the length of battles than in your actual character level. Once you hit 15 and hop into your first 5-man dungeon it starts to feel like more of a punishment than an education tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up changing the amount that of time it takes for your glucose to go down based on what type of "instance" you're currently in. So far it only changes if you're in a raid or 5-man dungeon. But implementing it through the instance check also will allow me to change it for player vs player environments as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The add-on as a whole still has a long way to go, but it's finally starting to feel much more playable in my experience, and I can't wait to see what else I end up getting to learn through the creation of it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="BizLeg"></category><category term="HFOSS"></category></entry><entry><title>Trademarks and Your Foss Project</title><link href="/trademarks-and-your-foss-project.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-02-26T14:25:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Alexandria Mack</name></author><id>tag:,2015-02-26:trademarks-and-your-foss-project.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;#ianyl&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October 22, 2014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Gist&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trademarks are a very complicated matter. It's important to keep your mark and to keep it distinguished. But in the FOSS community it's extremely important that you don't push your users away but having an overly strict Trademark policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Good&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even though she's a lawyer, she's also very clear that this isn't legal advice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She is very clear about everything and uses a lot of different types of examples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Bad&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FDA doesn't review the code on medical devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She says umm a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It sounds like she's talking faster than normal, and not breathing naturally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Questions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have to do more than just protect your mark from genericide?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you've done everything that you can
3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Review&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen does a really good job of breaking down Trademarks so that pretty much anybody can understand them. She uses a lot of examples to help get her point across and to help with understanding.

&lt;p&gt;This contains a general overview of Trademarks. You shouldn't try to trademark a generic name such as "music player". Unlike with patents, you should search Trademarks, including things that are unregistered. Registering yours give you stronger protection that not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Good&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They're very clear you should seek profession advice if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extremely thourough amounts of information, such as pricing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike in the Patents, they gave a clear example when talking about giving permission for outside people to use a trademark.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Bad&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's no examples for what might count as a specimen outside of what the USPTO requires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This chapter didn't speak at all to laws outside of the US and how that might affect software projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It ends.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter gave a very good overview of Trademarks and some good examples of how to use one or to deal with other people using them. It reiterates

&lt;p&gt;While using an add-on that helps to track raiding achievements in World of Warcraft(WoW), I noticed that it was outputting some data wrong. When creating an add-on for WoW you can create what are called slash commands. These are commands that interact with your add-on specifically when a user types '/' and then the command. I noticed that instead of telling you to type '/achr' it was saying to type '/rach'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reproducing It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log in to WoW.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open your add-ons list and ensure AchievementsReminder is turned on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter any dungeon or raid instance that you can still earn ten or more achievements in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the output and notice the incorrect slash command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fixing It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading through other peoples add-on code is always interesting. You get to see the ways they decided to use what little Blizzard allows players to interact with in the in-game application program interface(API). A lot of add-ons use seperate files to save all of the text that will be output to the user. This allows you to easily implement localization. Looking through the english localization, I was able to quickly locate which variable was outputting the incorrect string and was able to correct it. From there I was able to do the same for most of the other localization files. Some of them, however, were done using a foreign alphabet, which made it so I wasn't able to correct those. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="HFOSS"></category></entry><entry><title>Promises: Red Hat, IBM Patent, Google Patent, Comparisons</title><link href="/promises-red-hat-ibm-patent-google-patent-comparisons.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-02-20T16:43:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Alexandria Mack</name></author><id>tag:,2015-02-20:promises-red-hat-ibm-patent-google-patent-comparisons.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Who&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Gist&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple companies have published promises that they won't come after open source projects for patent infringement of certian patents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Good&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red Hat is standing against patents, and even though they hold some, if your software is free and open source, and under one of their approved licenses they won't target you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies are at least somewhat trying to allow open source to thrive, even when it might be something that company owns a patent for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These help to promote the open source community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Bad&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too much legalese. It would be awesome if someone who knows legalese would take things like these and put them in layman's terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of these companies are still more interested in protecting themselves than they are helping out the open source community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even after digging in to some of the legalese, they still seem fairly vague.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Questions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did these companies amass all of their patents?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red Hat seems to be trying to help protect open source but the others seem more interested in protecting themselves. Is this true?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any times where someone has ended up in a legal battle with one of these companies after they published their promises?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Review&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These promises provide a lot of information about specific patents that are currently held by differenet companies, and how that affects the open source community.

&lt;p&gt;Another add-on that I use does this specific thing as well. So for the next few days that code and I are going to be best friends.

That's all well and good, but this course has really opened my eyes to how these types of laws can work against creativity.

I fixed a bug that came about from my earlier fix dealing with crossrealm raiding. I also added in a couple of different features that will hopefully help keep some drama out of the master loot process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first deals with the idea that people can now kill a boss multiple times in one week, however they're only allowed to get loot the first time. This issue causes less drama, however it can still cause some. In order to combat this, I added a check before a character's roll is even reported in the add-on. If this check returns that you are eligible for the loot, the roll gets added to the list. Otherwise the addd-on just ignores it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other deals specifically with the characters chosen class and what armor category is optimum for them. For some classes, like the warrior, they can wear any type of armor, however wearing armor made of cloth won't give them as much protection as something made of plate. This next feature, just like the last, makes a check before the list updates with a characters roll. If the character either can't wear the armor or shouldn't wear the armor it won't show up in the roll list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future I would like to add another feature that prints out to the group why their roll wasn't added to the list. So far the reasons to be excluded include: rolling more than once(only first roll is included), not being eligible for loot from that specific boss, or it not being the optimum category for your class. This feature will also help deal with drama when people try to complain that you aren't reading their rolls, or that they had a higher roll, when really it was a second or maybe even third roll.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="BizLeg"></category><category term="HFOSS"></category></entry><entry><title>Patent Defenses for FOSS Developers</title><link href="/patent-defenses-for-foss-developers.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-02-16T23:29:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Alexandria Mack</name></author><id>tag:,2015-02-16:patent-defenses-for-foss-developers.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Who&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 4, 2008&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Gist&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reading a patent it is recommended to start with the claims, as this is the "legally binding" portion. The file wrapper is also important as it could contain statements that limit the patent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Good&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The footnotes hold some interesting and potentially useful information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once again the authors are very clear that they aren't trying to give legal advice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This gives a good overview of how patents work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Bad&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This chapter was much more dry and harder to read than previous chapters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would be helpful to have an example showing what they're talking about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's a very foreboding chapter, that makes it seem like patents could ruin everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Questions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The idea of willful infringement doesn't really make sense, just because you know about something doesn't mean you realized that you used it. How do they prove willful infringement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the "file wrapper" the legal name for those documents, or is that a colloquialism because they're talking specifically about software?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do they decide if you're ex parte or inter partes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Review&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chapter was extremely dry and didn't have much information past what is a patent and a few ways you might be able to get past patent infringement. It would have benefitted greatly from having an example patent, even if it wasn't a legitimate patent.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These documents illustrate the importance of clarification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In comparison to other documents of similar ilk, these weren't long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These documents were extremely descriptive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Bad&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a lot of "legalese".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All caps through some sections makes it extremely hard to read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having an FAQ at the top might help people understand what it's saying a bit better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Questions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can Apple really tell the "organizer" that they can't have access to something an ex "family member" downloaded even though the "organizer" paid for it?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Are TOS and EULA's legally binding?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Review&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reading is extremely dry and strewn with legalese. It's not even really clear if they're legally binding.

&lt;h4&gt;The Gist&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining how and why open source projects work is a very complicated matter. It doesn't follow the normal programming flow. It is fairly impossible to know how many people contribute to the open source community, or to know those peoples motivations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Good&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like the use of she for the pronoun instead of having a majority of hes throughout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a decent number of graphs to help show data as they talk about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It compares code to both poetry and midieval architectures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Bad&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of the footnotes being at the bottom of the pages it seems they're all at the end of the book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It really bothers me that the author will start talking about something and then say he'll talk more about it in a different chapter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extremely in-depth, sometimes too much so.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why were VA Linux and Red Hat Software so successful out of the gate on Wall Street?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Brooke's Law is true, why are there so many extremely large programming teams? Wouldn't it make more sense to have smaller teams?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Gist&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software Freedom encompasses multiple different ideas, and different license types give different ammounts of freedom. Copyright is also an important part of dealing with free software, even though copyright is normally seen as taking away freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Good&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The information is broken down to make it feel more readable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a lot of interesting information about copyright and how it affects the GPL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The footnotes hold links to even more good information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Bad&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It presents ideas without giving real world examples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The content is very dense and hard to read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would be nice to have examples of where different licenses won't work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Questions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any negatives associated with creating open source software?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we create different business models around open source software?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does it mean for the goverments software to be public domain? How is that different from open source software?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Gist&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A place to start learning about the different types of licenses and other important legal things for people just joining the FOSS community. It's also something that could be good to keep on hand for a refresher in some of the different licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The information is in-depth enough to give good detail, but it's also not in straight legalese, so it's readable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are very clear that this information is just to help get you started and isn't legal advice up front.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This document gives examples of some of the different types of licenses for you to look. It doesn't just explain how they work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Bad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's getting "old", in the technological sense, even though it's actually not that old.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The list of licenses, and license families, covered is extremely small, while it seems like the list of licenses in existance is much bigger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After saying there was no legal advice in this document, the way the wording is in some portions sounds more like advice on how to handle situations by yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does working on a project for a class and then continuing on that project as a paid project affect the ownership of the project?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the AGPL in what form does your source code have to be offered? Does it have to be shipped with the software, or can it just be made available via the internet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do non-compete clauses aversely affect the FOSS community?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foss Legal Primer has a lot of good information. It is very in-depth when it needs to be, but not so much as to make it unreadable for your average person.

&lt;h3&gt;When&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 25, 2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Gist&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy, Transform, Combine. This is the basis of all creativity. Intelectual Property has overtaken the idea of the common good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an extremely well thought out argument. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When he was talking about the videos his visuals were extremely helpful.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For people who already use ideas from other places and just combine them in different ways it's nice to know other people have done it too. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Bad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There wasn't a link in the description to their sources page. I had to dig into their website. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When he was talking about everything besides the videos the visuals were extremely distracting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It could be very disheartening for a person who thinks their ideas are original to realize that they might not be. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does everyone purposely use other things the way George Lucas did, or is it done accidentally?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why did James Kirby make this video?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is it actually determined if code has been copied?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is a Remix is an interesting way to show how many of our famous works, including videos, songs, and code, are all derivatives.

I did however get to take the chance to figure out how Ghost deals with RSS feeds. After a certain number of posts it cuts it off and adds another page. One way of dealing with this is to do the feed by tags. This is accomplished by adding /tag/thetagused/rss - thetagused being whatever tag you want the feed to be associated with. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="BizLeg"></category><category term="HFOSS"></category></entry></feed>
