</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>The first day of PyCon was a short day. There was a dinner to kick things off, then people started walking around to each of the booths. It was a very interesting experience for me as I didn't really know any Python at the beginning of the week. But I was getting to talk with people about the cool things that our program was doing, and getting to show of the course software we use. A lot of people were really curious about the fact that we use software for our courses that was different from what the rest of the college uses. There were also a lot of people that really enjoyed the fact that the students have to write blog posts. Much like my professor believes, they like the fact that it gives students a chance to work on their writing skills, while also writing about something that they enjoy.</p>
