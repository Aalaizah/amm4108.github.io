<h1>Community Architecture</h1>
<p>Your subject likely runs or contributes to one or more Open Source products or projects. Choose one (or more) of these and answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If applicable, list and provide links to:<ul>
<li>irc://irc.freenode.net#sugar or irc://irc.freenode.net#fedora-olpc</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar">Source Code repository</a></li>
<li><a href="http://lists.sugarlabs.org/listinfo/sugar-devel">Mail list - Developers</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Welcome_to_the_Sugar_Labs_wiki">Documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sugarlabs.org/">Sugar Labs website</a></li>
<li><a href="http://planet.sugarlabs.org/">Blog</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sugar is the core component of a worldwide effort to provide every child with equal opportunity for a quality education.</li>
<li>The first commit was Apr 16, 2006. The latest commit was Apr 28, 2015.</li>
<li>Each core module and activity has it's own project lead and co-maintainers.</li>
<li>There are 62 people who have had commits accepted into the main project.</li>
<li>The core commiters have changed over time. At the beggining there were 3 major commiters who haven't added anything in awhile.</li>
<li>Daniel Varvaez is the Lead maintainer for the core sugar project.</li>
<li>There are different people working on the frontend and the backend.</li>
<li>Participation seems to be trending down recently but there was a big push between October 2014 and January 2015.</li>
<li>The project would pass the raptor test as there are multiple people running each team.</li>
<li>I don't think this project would pass the bus test. The documentations isn't as detailed as it could be.</li>
<li>Contributing to both the main process and adding new activities has a well documented getting started guide.</li>
<li>The documentation is well broken up so you only need to look at the things for the particular thing you're doing, such as the main project or an activiy.</li>
<li>I would contact the maintainers for whichever porition of the project I was working on, either by email or hopping into IRC.</li>
<li>Each individual portion of Sugar has it's own ruling group.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Technology/Product</h1>
<ul>
<li>Sugar Labs helped produce the operating system and environment that runs on the One Laptop Per Child laptops.</li>
<li>Sugar OS is based off of Fedora and includes the “Sugar software.”</li>
<li>Sugar software is typically written in Python which is then turned into a Sugar activity that can be installed on OLPC laptops.</li>
<li>Also provide “Sugar-on-a-stick” which is a live USB based off Fedora that can be booted on any computer to use the Sugar environment.</li>
</ul>
